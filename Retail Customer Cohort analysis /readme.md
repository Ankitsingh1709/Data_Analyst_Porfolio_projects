# Background
This case study is provide by wolt a leading platform that's makes it easy for customers to order whatever they need on one app, for merchants to make additional sales, and for couriers to make meaningful earnings flexibly.
- The data is an artificial dataset that could be produced by wolt purchase process, where a user makes their first and possibly following purchases from Wolt.  
- Wolt has separated these purchases into two files, the first one containing only the usersâ€™ first ever purchases from Wolt **first_purchases**, and the second one containing all purchases from these users **purchases**.

# Project overview
The project task is to see how well Wolt manages to retain its customers month afeter month based on when users made their first ever purchase.
- Cohort based monthly retention for Retail product line.
- Cohort based monthly retention for Restaurant product line
I have used PostgreSQL with pgAdmin to solve the problem and Power BI for visualizations
