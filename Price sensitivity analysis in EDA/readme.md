# Background
Our client is PowerCo, a major gas and electricity utility company that supplies to corporate, SME (small and medium enterprise) and residential customers. The power liberalization of the energy market in Europe has led to significant customer churn, especially in the SME segment. They have partnered with us to help diagnose and drive the source of churning SME customers.

A fair hypothesis is that price changes affect customer churn. Therefore, it is helpful to know which customers are more likely to churn at their current price, for which a good predictive model could be useful.


# Project Overview

The project focuses on understanding customer churn within the energy industry. Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, refers to the phenomenon where customers stop using the services of a company and move to a competitor or discontinue using the service altogether. This project aims to analyze and model customer behavior to identify factors that contribute to churn and develop strategies to mitigate it.
