# Customer Churn Prediction

Welcome to my Customer Churn Prediction project! This repository houses a comprehensive analysis of customer churn in the telecommunications sector. The project showcases my expertise in data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization.

## Project Overview:

The Customer Churn Prediction project focuses on predicting customer churn in the telecommunications industry. Churn refers to the phenomenon where customers discontinue their services with a company. This project aims to understand the factors contributing to churn and develop predictive models to identify customers at risk of churning.

## Dataset:

The dataset used in this project contains customer information, including attributes such as gender, senior citizenship, partner status, tenure, service usage, contract details, payment methods, and more. The target variable is "Churn," which indicates whether a customer has churned (Yes) or not (No).

## Technologies Used:

- Data preprocessing and analysis: Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Data visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Machine learning: Scikit-Learn
- Model evaluation: Classification metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
- Model algorithms: Random Forest, Decision Tree.

## Key Insights:

1. **Churn Analysis:** We thoroughly analyze the churn rate and its distribution within the dataset.
2. **Feature Importance:** Determine which factors have the most significant impact on customer churn.
3. **Machine Learning Models:** Employ various classification algorithms to predict customer churn and assess their performance.

## Repository Contents:

- Jupyter notebooks with detailed data analysis and model building.
- Visualizations depicting churn patterns and key insights.
- Model evaluation and selection process.
- Code for data preprocessing and feature engineering.

## Results:

Our models aim to predict customer churn accurately, allowing telecom companies to take proactive measures to retain customers and enhance their services.
