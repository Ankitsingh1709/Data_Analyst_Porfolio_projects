## Movie Data Analysis

This project involves the analysis of a movie dataset using Python. The dataset contains information about various movies, including details such as name, rating, genre, year of release, score, votes, director, writer, star cast, country, budget, gross earnings, company, and runtime. The main objective of this project is to explore the dataset, visualize relationships between certain features, and calculate correlations among numeric attributes.

## ETL Pipeline

In addition to data analysis, this project features a robust ETL pipeline. The ETL process is a crucial component of any data project and encompasses the following stages:

- **Extract**: Data is obtained from one or more sources. In this project, the data can be sourced from various places such as CSV files, databases, or web APIs.

- **Transform**: Data is often not in the right format for analysis. The transformation step involves cleaning, aggregating, and structuring the data into a suitable format for analysis. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and performing feature engineering.

- **Load**: Once the data is transformed, it is loaded into a suitable storage or database for easy access and future use.

## Customer Churn in Telecommunications

The Customer Churn in Telecommunications project focuses on understanding and predicting customer churn within the telecommunications industry. Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, refers to the phenomenon where customers stop using the services of a company and move to a competitor or discontinue using the service altogether. This project aims to analyze and model customer behavior to identify factors that contribute to churn and develop strategies to mitigate it.

## Medical Cost Prediction
* Description: The project predicts the medical treatment cost by analysing the patients age, gender, bmi, smoking habits etc.
* Technologies Used: The notebooks uses Linear and Polynomial Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest Regressor
* Results: The Decision Tree Regressor and Random Forest Regressor performed well

## Salary Prediction
The focus of the Demographic-Based Salary Prediction project is to develop a predictive model that estimates the salaries of individuals from diverse countries and races based on their demographic attributes. These attributes encompass a range of variables, including occupation, age, gender, experience, and education. The dataset for this project, acquired from Kaggle, comprises 32,561 rows and 15 columns, with 8 independent variables and the target variable, "Salary."

## EDA Price sensitivity analysis
The primary objective of this project is to explore customer behavior within an energy company, particularly focusing on churners, and investigate their sensitivity towards pricing changes. The dataset pertains to PowerCo, an energy company supplying energy to small and medium-sized enterprises in the European market.
