## Overview

Welcome!! to my GitHub repository it's hosts a comprehensive project that combines data analysis and ETL pipeline, predictive models implementation using Python. The project focuses on data exploration, visualization, and automated data transformation to prepare it for further analysis.

## Data Analysis

In this project, we explore and gain insights from a dataset using Python. The code in this repository includes:

- **Data Exploration**: We start by examining the dataset's structure, identifying missing values, and providing an overview of the data.

- **Data Visualization**: You'll find various data visualizations to understand relationships between different variables. These visualizations include scatter plots, regression plots, and correlation matrices.

- **Correlation Analysis**: We calculate correlation coefficients between numeric features to uncover potential relationships within the data.

## ETL Pipeline

In addition to data analysis, this project features a robust ETL pipeline. The ETL process is a crucial component of any data project and encompasses the following stages:

- **Extract**: Data is obtained from one or more sources. In this project, the data can be sourced from various places such as CSV files, databases, or web APIs.

- **Transform**: Data is often not in the right format for analysis. The transformation step involves cleaning, aggregating, and structuring the data into a suitable format for analysis. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and performing feature engineering.

- **Load**: Once the data is transformed, it is loaded into a suitable storage or database for easy access and future use.

## Customer Churn in Telecommunications

The Customer Churn in Telecommunications project focuses on understanding and predicting customer churn within the telecommunications industry. Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, refers to the phenomenon where customers stop using the services of a company and move to a competitor or discontinue using the service altogether. This project aims to analyze and model customer behavior to identify factors that contribute to churn and develop strategies to mitigate it.

# Medical Cost Prediction:
* Description: The project predicts the medical treatment cost by analysing the patients age, gender, bmi, smoking habits etc.
* Technologies Used: The notebooks uses Linear and Polynomial Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest Regressor
* Results: The Decision Tree Regressor and Random Forest Regressor performed well

## Salary Prediction:
The focus of the Demographic-Based Salary Prediction project is to develop a predictive model that estimates the salaries of individuals from diverse countries and races based on their demographic attributes. These attributes encompass a range of variables, including occupation, age, gender, experience, and education. The dataset for this project, acquired from Kaggle, comprises 32,561 rows and 15 columns, with 8 independent variables and the target variable, "Salary."

## Contribution

Contributions to this project are encouraged! If you have suggestions for improvements, bug fixes, or new features, feel free to open an issue or create a pull request. Collaborative efforts can enhance this project and make it more beneficial to the community.

## Conclusion

This GitHub repository serves as a practical example of combining data analysis and ETL processes using Python. It is a valuable resource for learning about data analysis and building ETL pipelines for your data projects. Explore the code, adapt it to your needs, and leverage the insights gained from this project to enhance your data analysis skills and projects.

Enjoy exploring and working with data!
