# Creating Customer Profile for CardioGood Fitness

## Overview:
The market research team at AdRight is assigned the task to identify the profile of the typical customer for each treadmill product offered by CardioGood Fitness. The market research team decides to investigate whether there are differences across the product lines with respect to customer characteristics. The team decides to collect data on individuals who purchased a treadmill at a CardioGoodFitness retail store during the prior three months. 

### The team identifies the following customer variables to study: 
  - product purchased, TM195, TM498, or TM798; 
  - gender; 
  - age, in years; 
  - education, in years; 
  - relationship status, single or partnered; 
  - annual household income ; 
  - average number of times the customer plans to use the treadmill each week; 
  - average number of miles the customer expects to walk/run each week; 
  - and self-rated fitness on an 1-to-5 scale, where 1 is poor shape and 5 is excellent shape.

  ### Objective
The main objective of this project is to create a customer profile for CardioGood Fitness, which can be further used in:

- **Targeted Marketing Strategies**
- **Product Development and Enhancement**
- **Pricing Strategies**
- **Customer Retention and Loyalty Programs**

To achieve this, I will utilize statistical analysis and a correlation matrix to build a comprehensive customer profile.

### How creating customer profile can help businesses:
- Creating a customer profile can significantly benefit a business by providing a detailed understanding of its customer base. This understanding allows for the development of **targeted marketing strategies**, ensuring that promotional efforts reach the most receptive audience, thereby increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of marketing campaigns.
